CT60 Patch file list (tos directory)
====================================

boot2.S
-------
. Validation of the superscalar dispatcher on the 68060 (PCR).
. Initialization of the translation registers (on all 68060 types):
  the first zone is mapped from 0 to $7FFFFFFF in copyback, except for
  the zone mapped from 0 to $FFFFFF in writethrough; the second zone
  mapped from $80000000 to $FFFFFFFF with cache inhibited.
. Display of the 68060 type (revision, mask and frequency).
. Modification of PCR for the buggy revision 1 types.
. Reading and display of the SDRAM type from its EEPROM. 
. Declaration of the SDRAM to TOS.
. Initialization of the SDRAM, and display of MB/s while writing 
  to it.
. Creation of fastram buffer and the '_FRB' / 'XFRB' cookies.

pmmu2.c
-------
. Initialization of the PMMU tree (except for 68060 EC or LC), and
  the creation (if necessary) of the 'PMMU' cookie.  All of ST RAM
  is in writethrough and SDRAM is in copyback.
. Copying TOS to SDRAM if required (except for 68060 EC or LC). 

cookie.S
--------
. Installation of the cookies '_CPU', '_FPU', 'CT60'.

cache.S, pmmu.S, periph.S, movep.S, and movep2.S
------------------------------------------------
. Patches for cache, PMMU, address in $00FFxxxx, and the 
  replacement of movep instructions.

debug.S, debug2.S
-----------------
. Display plain text for register contents when exceptions occur.

vector.S, vectors2.S (fpsp.S, isp.S)
------------------------------------
. Emulation of unimplemented instructions (integers and FPU).

boot.S, boot2.S
---------------
. Boot order patch for IDE and SCSI drives.

xbios.S, xbios2.S
-----------------
. XBIOS CT60 functions $C60A to $C60D (temperature, parameters in flash,
  cache...), and the DSP functions with handshake. 

blitter.S, blitter2.S
---------------------
. Required patches for the blitter, the system fonts and the Atari logo
  copied to the top of ST RAM (needed if the TOS in ROM is v4.02).
. Blitter patches for the VDI functions vro_cpyfm, vr_trnfm, and vrt_cpyfm
  to work in SDRAM (an intermediate buffer inside ST RAM is used).

bios.S, bios2.S (conout.S)
--------------------------
. Replacement of the XBIOS Bconout routine.

videl.S, videl2.S (pic_boot.S)
-------------------------------
. Startup picture in 65K colors displayed for 2 seconds.

gemdos.S, gemdos2.S
-------------------
. Support Pexec function for copyback cache (cpush after relocation).
. Test and issue alert within Fload to try to fix crashes with programs 
  loaded without Pexec.

aes.S
-----
. AES patchs to change the Newdesk buffer from 4 KB to 32 KB.
. Icons patchs for 16M colors.


Note:
=====
xxxx2.S/c files are in the 2nd half of the flash $E8FFFF-$EFFFFF.
