With its FULL (FL) version, the 68060, like the 68040, integrates a
FPU (Coprocessor) that is really more powerfull than the old 68882.

With the LC version, the 060 has no FPU, this processor is not
supported since the boot 2.00.

With the EC version, the 060 has no FPU and no PMMU, this processor
is not supported since the boot 2.00.

The 060 is a dream and the first reason is its wonderfull computing
power regarding the previous ones in the 68K familly :

@{U}1.4  Overclocking the FALCON mainboard !                          CT60@{u}

It is possible to boost the Falcon mainboard from 16 to 20 MHz. In
such case, the DSP and VIDEL are clocked at 40 MHz. In this case, 6
wires have to be soldered on the mainboard...

@endnode


@node "Solders free !"
@toc "Presentation"
@{U}1.5  Solders free !                                               CT60@{u}

CT60 is PLUG'N PLAY !

The previous accelerator boards always required you cut and solder on
the motherboard, but now thanks to a revolutionnary hardware design,
the mainboard is not touched by the fitting.

From a base Falcon, there are ANY SOLDERS to fit the CT60 ! In this
case, the Falcon mainboard is not boosted.

The CT60 is compatible with all boosted Falcon mainboards, except
those boosted by a CT2...

From a CT2 accelerated Falcon, it is necessary to assemble back the
Falcon in base state. This means if you remove a CT2, you have to put
again the GAL chips U62,63,67,68 and U44, and the CPU if it was
unsoldered. The timings of the equations in those GAL were not
compatible with the accesses at 50 MHz by the CT2, especially for the
DSP. But CT60 accesses the Falcon at 16 MHz and this didn't ever
cause a problem in those GAL. If you didn't keep these components,
they will be furnished and the CPU will be freely soldered.

@node "BUS SLOT"

@{U}1.6  BUS SLOT                                                     CT60@{u}

CT60 is evolutive ! The 060 busses (Data, Add & Control) are present
on two HE13 Male connectors of 2x25 pins, giving a total of 100 pins.

The first add-on card that will be available is a PCI adaptor. This
one will be very performant because of the 060 accesses with 32-bit
wide data at 66 MHz, what is 8 times faster than the slow rate of the
actual or futur (?) Eclipse adaptor connected on the Falcon bus 16-
bit wide at 16 MHz : 66/16 MHz = 4.1 and 32/16 bits = 2. Sure, a new
Eclipse with 32-bit Data & 060 protocol could be a good solution...

And why not a AGP 1x adaptor at 66 MHz...

A PPC card is too possible because the 060 SLOT has MASTER
capabilities, the arbitration with the 060 being already included in
the CT60 logic.

In all case, the software & hardware developers are welcome.

@{U}1.7  FALCON BUS cards                                             CT60@{u}

ALL actual and old Falcon BUS add-on cards are compatible with the
CT60 !

Screen Eyes, Expose, Nova, Eclipse, Tempest (why not) can be used
with CT60 because CT60 don't modify the hardware of Falcon Bus (no
solders for the fitting).

The CT60 don't give you a new Falcon bus slot because it is not
needed ! The method is simple : keep your Falcon daughter card on the
Falcon slot and solder 2 Male/Male HE13 connectors (2x15 & 2x25) on
your 'old' card and plug the CT60 on it ! Sure, in this configuration
the keyboard is out of the Falcon case !

@{U}1.8  ATX Power Supply                                             CT60@{u}

CT60 needs a voltage of 3.3V and 8 Amperes at least for the 060, the
SDRAM, the 060 BUS port, the logic and the buffers, and the Falcon
power supply would have been not sufficient in the case of a 5V->3.3V
expensive voltage regulator on the CT60. An ATX power supply is
absolutely required to replace the Falcon power supply and free the
area for the CT60.

ATX power supplies of 250 Watts, with an ON/OFF AC switch, are
available anywhere for about 29 EUR.

@node "ATX Tower"
@toc "Presentation"
@{U}1.9  ATX Tower                                                    CT60@{u}

The CT60 is featured with a HE13 connector for the features found on
the front of a modern tower : POWER Led, IDE Led, RESET push button,
POWER push button. Plus (no more present on the ATX tower) a
NORMAL/TURBO switch you will have to fix somewhere.

With the POWER switch, you can power on your falcon. You have to
understand that the ATX power supplies (in the major cases) have no
more 120/240V ON/OFF switch because they are drived by the ACPI
modern OS functions allowing to set the computer in a 'standby' or
'suspend' mode instead of turning OFF the power supply. This low
power setting is done by the power push button of the tower, and the
CT60 is managing this feature !

A SLEEP function (SLP) was even added in the hardware and manageable
by a software (an ACC or a CPX) to 'sleep" the machine (like the
windows menu).

The Power Led has a double utility managed by the CT60 : When the
power supply is ON, the led lighting normally, and when the power
supply is suspended (off in fact), the led is lighting weakly
indicating that your machine is OFF but stills connected to AC power.

The 030 allows you to launch the old software that cannot run on the
060 and to copy/patch the TOS in the CT60 Flash.

The PMMU and DSP routs patchs are necessary, by example.

The Flash can be accessed by the 030 and by the 060 and will allow
all developers to modify and personalize their machine as they want.

The Falcon mode is your original Falcon and give you the inssurance
that software run like previously.

The small problems of the CT2, as the DSP INT, the FAST-Ram mapped by
the PMMU and the Bus Error under $400 are solved.

CT60 don't run without SDRAM !

The CT60 supports the PC100 & PC133 standard SDRAM DIMMs, but some
obsolet or uneeded DIMMs are not accepted.

In general, PC market provides Unbuffured 64-bits models, what you
need for CT60.

ATTENTION :

Don't confuse SDRAM (logical) banks (2 or 4 into a chip) with DIMM
(physical) banks (Single or double side DIMM) !

SDRAM DIMMs for CT60 :

   ù Must be PC100 or PC133 CL2.

   ù Must be UNBUFFURED.

   ù Must be populated with 4 logical banks chips (2 banks, obsolet,
     are refused). All DIMM > 32MB use 4 banks chips.

   ù 64 Bits (no Parity / ECC = 72 / 80 bits).

For get a better clock and remove crash at 100 MHz, you need this
modification :

At the left of the 100 MHz oscillator, there are IC3, a CY2309.

Inside this chip there are a PLL (Phase Locked Loop), it's possible
to use a part of this chip for obtain a better clock.

The pin 9 is connect to the ground, cut this pin.

There are two solutions for install a programmable clock generator on
the CT60 :

   ù The first, more precise, use a german module ak-modul-bus with a
     chip Cypress CY27EE16 (quartz reference and phase looked loop
     PLL).

   ù The second, less expensive on a little board, use a CTCM module
     with a chip Dallas DS1085Z-50 (voltage control oscillator VCO).

@{U}3.3.1  The ak-modul-bus module with a CY27EE16                    CT60@{u}

It's possible to add a programmable clock generator by step of 125
KHz on the CT60. The module use a CY27EE16 connected on the CT60
oscillator socket and two SDRAM module I2C signals SDA (82) and SLC
(83) found on R11 / R12.

Because the module need a DIL24 socket and the CT60 clock has a DIL14
socket, you can use some wires for connect the module to the CT60
like this :


@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\pclock.img 3


@{U} ATTENTION ! @{u}

If you think you're not ready to solder two very fine wires on R11
and R12, return the CT60 and put the 2 wires on the pins 82 and 83 of
the SDRAM socket (front right). Rodolphe suggest to use the DIL14
socket by the pins 2 (SCL to the pin 83 of the SDRAM socket) and 3
(SDA to the pin 83 of the SDRAM socket) in order to remove easily the
clock module.

Reduce the wire CLK at the minimum size, the best is to put the top
of the module (pins 18 to 24) on the CT60 clock socket (pins 8 to 14)
with an extension connector. You must at minimum to cut the pins
21/23 on the module, otherwise there are a short circuit with the
CT60 CLK and the 3V3.

     types), the first zone mapped to 0 at $7FFFFFFF in copyback
     excepted for the zone mapped to 0 … $FFFFFF in writethrough, and
     the second zone mapped to $40000000 at $FFFFFFFF in cache
     inhibed.

   ù The reading and the display of the SDRAM's type from his EEPROM.

   ù The copy of the TOS in SDRAM after apply the patches.

   ù The initialization of the PMMU tree. All the ST-RAM is in
     writethrough and the SDRAM declaration in copyback.

   ù The installation of the cookies '_CPU', '_FPU', 'CT60', and also
     '_FRQ' (internal clock) and '_FRE' (external clock) if the videl
     need to use an external 32 MHz clock for RGB monitors. The CT60
     cookie can return the speed frequency of a fan connected on IO3
     MFP.

   ù The patchs for cache, PMMU, address in $00FFxxxx, and the
     instructions movep replaced.

   ù The bombs inside exceptions displayed with texts in clear of a
     crash.

   ù The emulation of unimplemented instructions (integers and FPU).

   ù The XBIOS CT60 function $C60A to $C60D (temperature, parameters
     in Flash, cache...), and the DSP (functions with handshake).

   ù The needful patchs for the blitter, the system fonts and the
     Atari logo copied at the top of the ST-RAM (needed if the TOS in
     ROM is a 4.02).

   ù The replacement of the XBIOS Bconout routine (display texts).

   ù The picture in 65K colors displayed during 2 seconds.

   ù Check and fix the modecode get from NVM.

   ù Check and set the serial programmable clock (I2C port).

   ù Start the PCI BIOS and the drivers (if drivers.hex is loaded).

   ù The display of the 68060's type (revision, mask and frequency).

   ù The modification of PCR for the bugged types revision 1.

   ù The declaration of the SDRAM to the TOS.

   ù The initialization of the SDRAM, and the MB/s during writing
     displayed.

   ù The fastram buffer created and his cookie '_FRB'.

   ù The extended fastram buffer created and his cookie 'XFRB'.

   ù Lot of infos displayed about the SDRAM module.

   ù The patch for the boot order of the drives IDE and SCSI (4
     choices).

   ù Extra boot features :

        - Add identify device procedure for SCSI and IDE drives, the
          boot wait if a removable drive is not ready.

        - Add IDE slave support.

        - Add CompactFlash support.

        - Add combined MSDOS/TOS root and partition support, this
          feature support byte swapping needed by MSDOS format and
          search a *.SYS for load the disk driver.

        - Add speed test for bootables devices.

   ù The patch for the boot menu.

   ù The displays redirection of the AUTO programs to a file
     boot.log.

   ù The patch for the Pexec function for the copyback (cpush after
     the relocation).

   ù The blitter patchs of the VDI functions, vro_cpyfm, vr_trnfm,
     and vrt_cpyfm for work in SDRAM (an intermediate buffer inside
     ST-RAM is used).

   ù The AES patchs for change the Newdesk buffer of 4 KB to 32 KB.

   ù Scan-codes used with the Eiffel card :

        - PAGE UP/DOWN.

        - PRINT SCREEN.

        - POWER (set 2 only, Eiffel 1.0.5).

If the reading and the display of the SDRAM's type from his EEPROM is
good but for example if the TOS logo not appears, maybe than the
SDRAM is defective or not adapted for the CT60.

For test the SDRAM :

   ù In normal mode and with the configuration CPX for the CT60, set
     the delay at boot to 60 seconds.

   ù Switch off the computer.

   ù Set the turbo mode.

   ù Set the power to on.

   ù After the SDRAM initialization (to 0), begin the ST-RAM test and
     after the TT-RAM test (the SDRAM here), if the 'X' characters
     replaces the '-' characters, the SDRAM is defective.

For see 'Informations about the SDRAM' :

During boot the Atari logo is displayed, press the right SHIFT key.

Select a single test or any combination of tests by typing the
corresponding letter or letters, then typing the RETURN key. To run
repeated cycles of the test or (tests), follow the last letter with
the number of cycles to run. For example, "RSM25", will run RAM,
Serial, and MIDI tests 25 times. If 0 is entered, testing will be
continuous.

Use the ESC key to quit the test cycle. In some cases there will be a
delay before control returns to the keyboard.

An RS232 terminal may be used for input and display. The Serial RS232
test will not pass if a terminal is installed in place of the
loopback plug.

Normally a color monitor is used for all tests accept high
resolution. If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed
and the screen will turn red. When the test completes, Pass or Fail
will be displayed, and the screen will turn green or red.

If multiple tests are run and an error occurs on any test, the screen
will remain red, although successive tests pass. Once the test has
halted, the SPACE BAR is used to return to the menu.

The DMA and Printer/joystick/game port tests require that the port
test fixtures be connected.

The O.S. ROM test calculates a checksum/CRC of the ROMs and compares
the resultant CRC with the value found in the ROMs.

If the RAM test fails, the error code, address, data written, data
read and bad bits (0-15) are displayed.

The short Blitter test does not display any graphics on the screen.
The long Blitter test, while appearing not to finish the rectangle,
is ok.

@{B} OPERATOR REQUIRED TESTS @{b}

The Audio, Video, Keyboard, and IDE Hard Disk tests have few error
messages. The operator must determine if the output results are
acceptable.

The Gen/lock test is run twice. Toggling the switch on the gen/lock
fixture should switch between the normal menu and no menu. With no
menu a "sweeping" cycle should be heard. Reset the computer with each
change of the gen/lock switch.

NOTE - RUN THIS TEST ONLY WITH A COLOR MONITOR.

The main task of this program is to put TOS binary (.BIN) or Srecord
files (.HEX) inside the flash. It's also possible to update the flash
with the 68060 (turbo mode).

Since the BOOT v2.0, it's possible to load separate files for the
TOS404, the BOOT and the PCI drivers for the CTPCI:

   ù CT60TOS.BIN: contains BOOT + TOS404 + Atari Diagnostics (must
     disappear).

   ù BOOT.HEX: contains the BOOT.

   ù DIAG.HEX: contains the Atari Diagnostics.

   ù DRIVERS.HEX: contains the PCI drivers (GPL licence, overwrites
     DIAG.HEX).

   ù TOS404.BIN (not in the archive): just for put the TOS in flash,
     in the case of CT60TOS.BIN isn't used.


@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\flash2.img 18


The second task is to update the CT60 hardware with two jedec files
(.JED) for ABE60, SDR60 and CTPCI chips (XILINX XC95144XL / XC95288XL
CPLD).

   ù You need to make the cable for the JTAG CT60 connector linked to
     // port, look at 'JTAG/parallel download cable'.

   ù Normally the cable must be attached and powered (by the CT60)
     for proper verification. Only SDR60 can be programmed (or
     verified) when the CT60 is connected to the mother board in
     normal 030 mode (if you use the same machine CT60/F030 ;-) ). If
     you update the ABE60 chip you need to remove the CT60 from the
     bus excepted if there are a 1Kohms resistor between GND (Ground)
     and the pin #1 of one of the three 74LVC245 chips. In this case
     the blitter must not be used (NVDI installed).

   ù If you load the good jedec files, another button appears
     'verify'. You can use this button for compare the jedec file
     with the chip. The 'program' button erase, program, and verify
     his flash.

@{U}7.1  Introduction                                                 CT60@{u}

The CT60's configuration is set with a CPX, used normally with
XCONTROL, ZCONTROL, or COPS.

This CPX allows to :

   ù Configure the Non Volatile Memory.

   ù Configure the boot in Flash Eprom.

   ù Measure MIPS.

   ù See the load of the system (MiNT or MagiC only).

   ù Measure the temperature of the 68060 (for overclocking) => With
     the driver CT60XBIO.PRG or the TOS in flash.

   ù Switch off the computer.

   ù See 'Informations about the SDRAM'.


@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\cpx2.img 19


There are five common buttons on this CPX :

   ù Save : Button for save adjustments on the disk.

   ù Load : Button for load adjustments saved on the disk.

   ù OK : Button for validate the values changed into the non
     volatile ram and the flash parameters.

   ù Cancel : Button for not change values to the configuration.

   ù i : Button for display informations (authors and SDRAM).

For check the temperature and use curves, the CPX :

   ù Under TOS create a desk-accessory CT60TEMP.ACC and ask to
     reboot.

   ù Under MiNT create the program CT60TEMP.APP and start this
     program.

   ù Under MagiC start a thread.

Note: On the CT63, the temperature level is to 0 (hardware wired by
Rodolphe).

@{U}7.4.1  Change the CT60 frequency                                  CT60@{u}

With the slider inside the page 'Memory / uP' of the CPX, if
necessary it's possible to change the CT60 frequency.

For do this task, a programmable clock generator module using a
CY27EE16 or a DS1085Z-50 must be connected on the CT60's I2C port
with some wires (see also the part 'Programmable clock generator').

The adjustment works by step of 125 KHz between 50 and 110 MHz for
the CY27EE16 (ak-modul-bus module), or by step of 50 KHz between 66
and 110 MHz for the DALLAS DS1085Z-50 (CTCM module), the value is
writed in RAM for a test after 'OK'. The TOS during the boot when the
Atari logo arrive send equally this value to the clock, but in case
of a problem it's possible to bypass this feature and use the
original frequency by press CTRL or ALT.

A user clock is available, this is the CT60 frequency divided from 2
to 6.

@{U} ATTENTION ! @{u}

So long as you not cut the power on the machine, the clock gererator
works with the latest frequency writed inside his RAM. During the
power on sequency, the clock generator copy himself inside his RAM
the original frequency saved in his EEPROM. Press on CTRL or ALT has
no effect if you not cut the power before. You can also use CTRL-ALT-
UNDO for restore NVRAM/Flash parameters or use the 030 mode for
select another frequency.

@{U} Initialisation @{u}

The original frequency saved in EEPROM is also modifiable after a
confirmation with a double click on 'Save' but it's very dangerous !

Yet, when it's impossible to restart the computer, the last solution
is to connect the @{B} ak-modul-bus module @{b} on the MODEM 2 port with a
link HE10 SUBD and reprogram in 030 mode the EEPROM of the module
with the 'Save' button. This operation is essential for load a new
module. @{B} The module must be powered by the CT60 and the signals SDA
and SCL must be disconnected because during the 030 mode the CT60
force these signals to 0 ! @{b}


@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\subd.img 12


When it's impossible to restart the computer with the @{B} CTCM module @{b}
you must cut the strap for divide by two the frequency (clock between
33 and 66 MHz), and after reprogram again the module with the CT60 by
saving a new value inside the EEPROM. Now, the frequency is
multiplyed by two when the strap is again in place !

The CT60 not start with the Falcon boost if the strap is removed
(F030 frequency > CT60 frequency so 33 MHz).

Like the @{B} ak-modul-bus module @{b}, the last solution is to connect the @{B}
CTCM module @{b} on the MODEM 2 port with a link HE10 SUBD and reprogram
in 030 mode the EEPROM of the module with the 'Save' button.

@{B}WARNING! The boot 2.0 not support this jumper because the CTCM clock
is not stable (no PLL) and it's impossible to read the state of the
jumper.@{b} So the frequency range is 66 to 110 MHz (the DALLAS used on
the CTCM isn't certified for work below 66 MHz).

Under a multitasking operating system (for example MagiC, MultiTOS,

will be automatically started as a GEM program on booting the system.

Under single TOS BubbleGEM can be run as a desk accessory by renaming
BUBBLE.APP to BUBBLE.ACC and copying it to the root directory of your
boot partition, then rebooting.

BubbleGEM-aware programs send a message and pass a character string
to BubbleGEM if the user clicks with the right mouse button on an
icon, button or window area. BubbleGEM then displays the character
string, formatted in a cute speech bubble which remains displayed
until the user moves the mouse pointer to another window area, or
until the user clicks again to burst the bubble.

Optionally bubbles can be displayed by clicking and holding down the
right mouse button; in this case the bubble bursts as soon as the
button is released again.

While a bubble is open two keyboard shortcuts are active:

<CTRL C> : The content of the bubble is copied to the clipboard and
           the bubble remains open.
<CTRL X> : The content of the bubble is copied to the clipboard and

There are two caches of 8KB inside the 68060, data and instruction.

The ST-RAM is in writethrough, at each time than the 68060 write to
the RAM, he write in the same time than the data cache.

The SDRAM is in copyback, the 68060 write always inside his data
cache, he write in the memory the old data of his cache for found
some place for the new data.

The 68060 has also an instruction cache, witch the direct link with
the data cache is only the memory. The result is than it's possible
to obtain incoherency between the data cache and the instruction
cache. The example is the exceution of a relocated program, without
precaution and without system call this is a crash.

The 68060 has the ability to watch or snoop the external bus during
accesses by other bus masters (like DMA or blitter), maintaining
coherency between the 68060's caches and external memory.

Like CPX, the programs who not uses the Pexec function for load
modules crashes with the SDRAM in copyback, so the best way is to
load the program in ST-RAM (cache in writethrough). You can use
FILEINFO.CPX for change the flags.

For example you must remove TT-ram flags of METAXBS.PRG (Metados)
because when the OVL modules are loaded there are no flush after

@{U}10.4  HARDWARE EMULATION                                          CT60@{u}

The CT60 allows a @{B} Falcon hardware emulation. @{b}

With this Hardware Emulation Window, it is easy to implement a new
chip replacing the old one of the Falcon motherboard and this at the
same address(es) !

@{U} Examples : @{u}

   ù SUPER-VIDEL chip in a FPGA with DDR memory.

   ù SDRAM replacement of a part of the ST-RAM at the same addresses.

   ù ACIA for new PS/2 ports with a CPLD/FPGA.

   ù ACIA MIDI with a CPLD/FPGA.

   ù DSP56301 replacing 56001 at same addresses !

   ù FPGA emulating serial & parallel port of the Falcon (Zilog 85C30
     and Yamaha).

   ù New SDMA for Audio.

There is a time window from the start of the 060 access to the Falcon
addresses ($00xxxxxx and $FFxxxxxx) up to the start (rising edge) of
the 7th cycle of the CLK (bus and 060 clock).

When the 060 inserts the addresses and TS to validate, a counter into
ABE start if the address is somewhere in the Falcon address space.
Until the counter reaches the end of the 6th cycle, a card on the 060
slot bus of the CT60 can answer to terminate the access instead of a
chip of the Falcon mb (with TA/ or TEA/ or both TA/ & TEA/ for a
RETRY). This termination of the access terminates the counter and
invalidates the Falcon acccess that was started.

At the begining of the 7th cycle the Falcon READ access continues and
cannot be stopped. ABE drives data on the CT60 bus.

The time limit for the termination signal sampling is the end of the
6th cycle.

@{U} If you want to use SDRAM on a daughter card : @{u}

For 66 MHz SDRAM BURST READ you need 5-1-1-1 cycles. The TA arrives
the 5th cycle (first data) up to 8th (fourth data). This TA arrives
before the end of the 6th cycle and the F030 access start is
cancelled.

For 66 MHz SDRM BURST WRITE you need 3-1-1-1 cyles. The TA arrives
the 3rd cycle (first data) up to 6th (fourth data). This TA arrives
before the end of the 6th cycle and the F030 access start is
cancelled.

@{U} For registers accesses on a daughter card, you need 2 or 3 cycles. @{u}

If you want to write both to F030 mb AND your daughter card (an
address that is present on the two boards), don't send TA from the
daughter card and the TA from mb will terminate the write access for
you.

@{U} By example, @{u} this technic allows to write all VIDEL and SUPER VIDEL
registers in the same time. The emulation is total! The only thing is
to do is to implement a bit in the daughter board to @{B} switch ON/OFF
the emulation. @{b}

@{B} If the switch is ON : @{b}

   ù the daugther card address registers are at the same addresses
     than the F030 mb and :

   ù the TA must not be sent when writting these registers that are
     common to F030 and the daughter card.

   ù the TA must be sent before the 7th cycle when reading from
     register that is a common to F030 & daughter card.

@{B} If the switch is OFF : @{b}

   ù the daughter card address registers must be present at some
     specific addresses (not the same than the F030) and the TA is
     sent as usual by the daughter card for all read & write
     accesses.

@{U} Example with $FFFF820E : @{u}

Switch is ON -> Write at $FFFF820E write to daughter card and F030 mb
and this access is terminated by the TA from Falcon mb (ABE). The
card don't send TA.

Switch is OFF -> Write at $FFFF820E write only to Falcon mb. You need
to write to a 'new' address on the card to access the same register.

@{U}10.5  THERMAL SENSOR                                              CT60@{u}

The 68060 contains a Die Temperature Sensor with two external pins
THERM0 & THERM1. The sensor is done with a temperature sensitive
resistor which has a 780 ohms value at 25øC and increases/decreases
by steps of 2.8 ohms per øC unit. By example, a 060 core at 80øC
gives a resistance of 934 ohms between the two THERMx pins.

@{B} Equations : R60 = 780 + 2.8 x (TEMP 25) or TEMP = (R60 - 710) / 2.8 @{b}

The CT60 uses a small slow Analog/Digital converter (TI TLV0831) to
obtain a 8-Bit value of the voltage between the THERMs pins.

@{B} The equation is : U60 = (3.34 x R60) / (1000 + R60) @{b} where R60 is
the value of the core sensor resistor; 3.34 is the power supply and
1000 is the value of the resistor connected between the 3.34V and the
positive THERM0/IN+ line.

@{U} TOLERANCES : @{u}

   ù Power supply : 3.3V +/- 4% : From 3.168V to 3.432V. Curently, it
     is 3.30 to 3.34.

   ù Resistor : 1K +/-1% : From 990 to 1010 Ohms. Curently, it is
     from 995 to 1005 ohms.

The AD converter uses a REF voltage of 1.800 V. With 0 to 0.007 V
between the two pins of the AD converter, the digital result is 0.
With 1.794 to 1.800 V, the result is 255. The value
increases/decreases by steps of 0.007 V.

@{B} The equation is : Data = INT [U60/0.007]. @{b}

At   0øC : Vin+ = 1.387 V  Data = 197  R60=710
At  25øC : Vin+ = 1.464 V  Data = 208  R60=780
At  50øC : Vin+ = 1.535 V  Data = 218  R60=850
At 100øC : Vin+ = 1.662 V  Data = 236  R60=990

@{U} ATTENTION : The varation of the data is not linear !! @{u}

The CPU must access the TLV831 by a basic bit-by-bit protocol. It is
the software responsibility to respect the protocol & timings of the
following chronogram, and assemble the bits.


@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\tlv.img 1
f   : Clock frequency                         10 to 600 kHz (typical = 250)
tsu : Setup time, CS LOW before CLK goes HIGH 350 ns MIN
tpd : Propagation delay time :
      output data after CLK goes HIGH         500 ns MAX (typical = 200)
twh : Pulse duration, CS HIGH                 220 ns MIN
tconv : Converstion Time (at 250kHz)          32 us

Three registers are present in the SDR60 chip.

The 060 CPU must drive THCS & THCK and read THDA by these registers.

The address $F1000000, $F1800000 & $F1000000 are used respectively
for THCS, THCK & THDA.

THCS (Chip Select)
LONG WRITE at $F1000000   WRITE 0 to CS Rising edge of CS (removed)
LONG WRITE at $F1400000   WRITE 1 to CS Falling edge of CS (active)

THCK (Clock)
LONG WRITE at $F1800000   WRITE 0 to CLK Falling edge of CLK
LONG WRITE at $F1C00000   WRITE 1 to CLK Rising edge of CLK

THDA (Data Output)
LONG READ at $F1000000   READ from DO
                         Value is available on D0 of the CPU data bus.

The EEPROM device conforms to the I2C 2-wire protocol. CT60 only uses
the random read operations with the EEPROM.

During data input, the EEPROM samples the SDA signal on the rising
edge of the clock (SCL). For correct device operation, the SDA signal
must be stable during the clock low to high transition and data must
change only when the clock (SCL) line is low.

@limage G:\tos060\doc\english\..\img\i2c2.img 1
The slave address is 1010000. The eight bit is the R/W bit.

Random read operations allow the master to access any memory location
in a random manner. Before issuing the slave address with the R/W bit
set to one (Read), the master must first perform a dummy write
operation. The master issues the start condition, slave address and
then the word address it is to read. After the word address ACK, the
master immediately re-issues the start condition and the slave
address with the R/W bit set to one. This will be followed by an ACK
from the slave and then by the eight bit word. The master will not
ACK the transfer but will issue a stop and the slave stops
transmission and goes into standby.

The device that controls the transfer is referred to as the master
(SDR60 chip) and the device that receives the data (EEPROM) is
referred to as the slave device. The master will always start a data
transfer (SDA line) and will provide the serial clock (SCL line) for
synchronization.

The 060 CPU must drive the SCL and SDA lines. These lines are
connected to 2 pins of the logic chip.

The address $F00xxxxx is used for SCL and $F08xxxxx is used for SDA
signal.

@{B} NOT SUPPORTED SDRAM DIMMs @{b}

   ù All DIMM with chips density < 64Mbits : 8MB, 16MB & 32MB DIMMs.
     All DIMMs with 2 logical banks chips = obsolet (CT60 needs 4
     logical banks chips).

   ù REGISTERED / BUFFURED DIMMs (generally for Work Stations &
     Servers, not PC).

   ù 512 MB DIMM with one physical bank (only 1 side populated).

@{B} REMARK : @{b}

Don't confuse SDRAM banks (2 or 4) with physical banks (1= Single
Size or 2 = Double Size) !

@{B} PERFORMANCES : @{b}

The better system performances is obtained with 16 KB page length
DIMMs.

@node "060 BURST with SDRAM"
@toc "CT60 HARDWARE GUIDE"
@{U}10.8  060 BURST with SDRAM                                        CT60@{u}

The CT60 bus clock = the 060 clock (060 in 'Full Bus mode').

The 060 uses @{B} LINE BURST @{b} to & from the system memory. SDRAM is well
adapted for a such processor !

A BURST LINE is a length of @{B} 4 LONG-WORDs (16 Bytes) @{b} that are
transferred with only :

@{B} PAGE HIT @{b} (access to a logical SDRAM page already open) :

   ù 3,1,1,1 = 6 cycles for Burst Writes. Rate is 16 Bytes / 6 cycles
     = 178 MBytes/s (Each access in the same page).

   ù 5,1,1,1 = 8 cycles for Burst Reads. Rate is 16 Bytes / 8 cycles
     = 132 MBytes/s (Each access in the same page).

@{B} PAGE MISS @{b} (access to a new logical SDRAM page (must be precharged
and open) :

   ù 7,1,1,1 = 10 cycles for Burst Writes. Rate is 16 Bytes / 10
     cycles = 107 MBytes/s (Each access in a new page).

   ù 9,1,1,1 = 12 cycles for Burst Reads. Rate is 16 Bytes / 12
     cycles = 89 MBytes/s (Each access in a new page).

The CT60 uses the 060 at the top of the possible performances with
the mighty @{B} COPYBACK @{b} mode ! Instead of the WRITETROUGH mode like
other TOS machines !

@{B} Copyback mode is active for all SDRAM memory area. @{b}

Copyback mode allows the 060 to write into the cache without writting
into the SDRAM, what is so more performant ! The cache lines are
pushed into SDRAM only when needed (060 needs place by example). With
@{B} two 8Kbytes caches, @{b} it gives to coders the possibility to do some
incredibly speed routs residing at 100% into the caches !

The 060 uses BURST transfers with SDRAM in 99% of the cases. Here are
the cases when the 060 don't burst, this means, transfers Bytes,
Words & Long-Words :

@{B} Byte, Word, and Long-Word READ Transfer Cycles from SDRAM @{b}

Accesses that are implicitly NONCACHABLE :

   ù Locked Read-Modify-Write accesses.

   ù Table Searches.

Accesses that are not allocate in the data cache on a read miss :

   ù Exception Vector Fetches.

   ù Exception stack Deallocation for an RTE Instruction.

@{B} Byte, Word, and Long-Word WRITE Transfer Cycles to SDRAM @{b}

Accesses that are implicitly NONCACHABLE :

   ù Locked Read-Modify-Write accesses.

   ù Table Searches.

Accesses that are not allocate in the data cache on a write miss :

   ù Exception stacking.

Cache Line pushes for lines containing a single dirty Long-word.

Write to WRITETHROUGH pages (ST-RAM !).

@{B} Remark : @{b}

For those of you who are a bit familiar with 64-bit processors like
PPC, don't forget that the syntax for data size is not the same :

@{B} With 32-Bit processors : @{b}

   ù A WORD designates a 16-Bit entity.

   ù LONG-WORD designates a 32-Bit entity.

@{B} With 64-Bit processors : @{b}

   ù A HALF-WORD designates a 16-Bit entity.

   ù A WORD designates a 32-Bit entity.

   ù A DOUBLE-WORD designates a 64-Bit entity.

CT60 adds some new interrupts for the 060 Bus Slot, re-routing of the
Falcon INT Set to the second CPU (CPU#2 on the Bus Slot).

@{B} The /I6 , and /INT were added on CT60. @{b}

/I6 is the interrupt from the 060 BUS SLOT and is merged with the
others from the Falcon. See table below for the priority position.

/INT is sent by SDR-60 to the CPU#2 to interrupt it. INT is
synthetized from the /IPL2, /IPL1 & /IPL0 signals and the I6. It is
necessary when the CPU#2 has to respond the interrupts instead of the
primary 060...

@{B} INT1 & INT3 are NO MORE SUPPORTED with CT60 ! @{b}

INT6 is also named MFPINT on atari documents because it is daisy
chained with the MFP.

To allow the PPC to read the level of the falcon re-routed
interrupts, the CT60 furnishes a register called (B!) IVR (Interrupt
Vector Register). @{b} The IVR column gives you the binary values encoded
by the SDR60 chip...

Note that the INT6, MFPINT and DSPREQ Interrupts are chained on the
level 6 line... (its a stock Falcon feature !).

It is planned that the PPC board will contain a mechanism register to
generate a '68K like' INT ACK cycle and receive the software Vector
from the Falcon data bus. On CT60, the IVR contains only the level of
the pending INT...
