You have more than enough to compile at the speed of a snail?

You want to surf quickly on Web?

You want calculate pictures under POV, make DTP or Graphics in a highly 
speed? 

You want to run suitably applications as one to encode MP3 or a console 
Java under Mint? 

You want keep totality of your software library?

You do not want you separate from all which makes the charm of your 
Falcon, his sound system, DSP, and all the connectique (SCSI, MIDI, 
Joystick ports, etc...)?  

You have not an accelerator or you search for an new fast accelerator, 
seize the opportunity ! 

Don't send your Falcon at the retirement !

!subnode Processor

With its FULL (FL) version, the 68060, like the 68040, integrates a FPU 
(Coprocessor) that is really more powerfull than the old 68882. 

With the LC version, the 060 has no FPU, this processor is not supported 
since the boot 2.00.

With the EC version, the 060 has no FPU and no PMMU, this processor is not
supported since the boot 2.00.

The 060 is a dream and the first reason is its wonderfull computing power 
regarding the previous ones in the 68K familly :

!subnode RAM

Upper 40 MHz, the SDRAM is accessed with 1 cycle while the EDO need 2 cycles.

The RAM of the CT60 is equivalent with the TT-Ram (same address : $01000000).

CT60 is the only one product that uses the SDRAM ! The consequences on 
performances are clear :

(MB=MegaBytes) - ALL TESTS REALIZED WITH NEMBENCH 2.1 in 2003 and 2010 for the CTPCI


!subnode Overclocking the FALCON mainboard !

It is possible to boost the Falcon mainboard from 16 to 20 MHz. In such 
case, the DSP and VIDEL are clocked at 40 MHz. In this case, 6 wires have 
to be soldered on the mainboard...  


!subnode Solders free !

CT60 is PLUG'N PLAY !

The previous accelerator boards always required you cut and solder on the 
motherboard, but now thanks to a revolutionnary hardware design, the 
mainboard is not touched by the fitting.  

From a base Falcon, there are ANY SOLDERS to fit the CT60 ! In this case, 
the Falcon mainboard is not boosted.

The CT60 is compatible with all boosted Falcon mainboards, except those 
boosted by a CT2... 

From a CT2 accelerated Falcon, it is necessary to assemble back the Falcon 
in base state. 
This means if you remove a CT2, you have to put again the GAL chips 
U62,63,67,68 and U44, and the CPU if it was unsoldered. 
The timings of the equations in those GAL were not compatible with the 
accesses at 50 MHz by the CT2, especially for the DSP. But CT60 accesses 
the Falcon at 16 MHz and this didn't ever cause a problem in those GAL.  
If you didn't keep these components, they will be furnished and the CPU 
will be freely soldered. 


!subnode BUS SLOT

CT60 is evolutive ! The 060 busses (Data, Add & Control) are present on 
two HE13 Male connectors of 2x25 pins, giving a total of 100 pins. 

The first add-on card that will be available is a PCI adaptor. This one 
will be very performant because of the 060 accesses with 32-bit wide data 
at 66 MHz, what is 8 times faster than the slow rate of the actual or 
futur (?) Eclipse adaptor connected on the Falcon bus 16-bit wide at 16 
MHz : 66/16 MHz = 4.1 and 32/16 bits = 2. Sure, a new Eclipse with 32-bit 
Data & 060 protocol could be a good solution...  

And why not a AGP 1x adaptor at 66 MHz...

A PPC card is too possible because the 060 SLOT has MASTER capabilities, 
the arbitration with the 060 being already included in the CT60 logic.  

In all case, the software & hardware developers are welcome.


!subnode FALCON BUS cards

ALL actual and old Falcon BUS add-on cards are compatible with the CT60 !

Screen Eyes, Expose, Nova, Eclipse, Tempest (why not) can be used with 
CT60 because CT60 don't modify the hardware of Falcon Bus (no solders for 
the fitting).  

The CT60 don't give you a new Falcon bus slot because it is not needed ! 
The method is simple : keep your Falcon daughter card on the Falcon slot 
and solder 2 Male/Male HE13 connectors (2x15 & 2x25) on your 'old' card 
and plug the CT60 on it ! Sure, in this configuration the keyboard is out 
of the Falcon case !


!subnode ATX Power Supply

CT60 needs a voltage of 3.3V and 8 Amperes at least for the 060, the 
SDRAM, the 060 BUS port, the logic and the buffers, and the Falcon power 
supply would have been not sufficient in the case of a 5V->3.3V expensive 
voltage regulator on the CT60. An ATX power supply is absolutely required 
to replace the Falcon power supply and free the area for the CT60.

ATX power supplies of 250 Watts, with an ON/OFF AC switch, are available 
anywhere for about 29 EUR. 


!subnode ATX Tower

The CT60 is featured with a HE13 connector for the features found on the 
front of a modern tower : POWER Led, IDE Led, RESET push button, POWER 
push button. Plus (no more present on the ATX tower) a NORMAL/TURBO switch 
you will have to fix somewhere.

With the POWER switch, you can power on your falcon. You have to 
understand that the ATX power supplies (in the major cases) have no more 
120/240V ON/OFF switch because they are drived by the ACPI modern OS 
functions allowing to set the computer in a 'standby' or 'suspend' mode 
instead of turning OFF the power supply. This low power setting is done by 
the power push button of the tower, and the CT60 is managing this feature ! 

A SLEEP function (SLP) was even added in the hardware and manageable by a 
software (an ACC or a CPX) to 'sleep" the machine (like the windows menu). 

The Power Led has a double utility managed by the CT60 : When the power 
supply is ON, the led lighting normally, and when the power supply is 
suspended (off in fact), the led is lighting weakly indicating that your 
machine is OFF but stills connected to AC power.


!subnode FALCON Mode

The 030 allows you to launch the old software that cannot run on the 060 
and to copy/patch the TOS in the CT60 Flash. 

The PMMU and DSP routs patchs are necessary, by example.

The Flash can be accessed by the 030 and by the 060 and will allow all 
developers to modify and personalize their machine as they want. 

The Falcon mode is your original Falcon and give you the inssurance that 
software run like previously. 

The small problems of the CT2, as the DSP INT, the FAST-Ram mapped by the 
PMMU and the Bus Error under $400 are solved. 


!node SDRAM

(!B)
By Rodolphe Czuba
(!b)

CT60 don't run without SDRAM !

The CT60 supports the PC100 & PC133 standard SDRAM DIMMs, but some 
obsolet or uneeded DIMMs are not accepted. 

In general, PC market provides Unbuffured 64-bits models, what you need 
for CT60. 

ATTENTION : 

Don't confuse SDRAM (logical) banks (2 or 4 into a chip) with DIMM 
(physical) banks (Single or double side DIMM) ! 


SDRAM DIMMs for CT60 :

!begin_itemize

!item Must be PC100 or PC133 CL2.

!item Must be UNBUFFURED.

!item Must be populated with 4 logical banks chips (2 banks, obsolet, are 
refused). All DIMM > 32MB use 4 banks chips. 

!item 64 Bits (no Parity / ECC = 72 / 80 bits).

!subnode CT60-100 clock

For get a better clock and remove crash at 100 MHz, you need this 
modification : 

At the left of the 100 MHz oscillator, there are IC3, a CY2309.

Inside this chip there are a PLL (Phase Locked Loop), it's possible to use 
a part of this chip for obtain a better clock.
 
The pin 9 is connect to the ground, cut this pin.

!subnode Programmable clock generator

There are two solutions for install a programmable clock generator on the 
CT60 :

!begin_itemize

!item The first, more precise, use a german module ak-modul-bus with a 
chip Cypress CY27EE16 (quartz reference and phase looked loop PLL).

!item The second, less expensive on a little board, use a CTCM module 
with a chip Dallas DS1085Z-50 (voltage control oscillator VCO).

!end_itemize


!subsubnode The ak-modul-bus module with a CY27EE16

It's possible to add a programmable clock generator by step of 125 KHz on 
the CT60. The module use a CY27EE16 connected on the CT60 oscillator socket 
and two SDRAM module I2C signals SDA (82) and SLC (83) found on R11 / R12.

Because the module need a DIL24 socket and the CT60 clock has a DIL14 socket, you 
can use some wires for connect the module to the CT60 like this :

!image ..\img\pclock.img
!begin_verbatim

!end_verbatim

(!U)
ATTENTION !
(!u)

If you think you're not ready to solder two very fine wires on R11 and R12, 
return the CT60 and put the 2 wires on the pins 82 and 83 of the SDRAM socket 
(front right). Rodolphe suggest to use the DIL14 socket by the pins 2 (SCL 
to the pin 83 of the SDRAM socket) and 3 (SDA to the pin 83 of the SDRAM 
socket) in order to remove easily the clock module.

!end_verbatim

Reduce the wire CLK at the minimum size, the best is to put the top of the 
module (pins 18 to 24) on the CT60 clock socket (pins 8 to 14) with an
extension connector.
You must at minimum to cut the pins 21/23 on the module, otherwise there are a 
short circuit with the CT60 CLK and the 3V3.

!item The programmable CT60 clock output is OUT0. If the CTRL0 input is 
at 1 the clock is between 33 and 66 MHz (strap cut). If the CTRL0 input 
is at 0 the clock is between 66 and 110 MHz (strap put).

(!B)WARNING! The boot 2.0 not support this jumper because the CTCM clock 
is not stable (no PLL) and it's impossible to read the state of the jumper.(!b)
So the frequency range is 66 to 110 MHz (the DALLAS used on the CTCM isn't 
certified for work below 66 MHz).

!item OUT1 can be used for user clock, but there are always a link with 
the CT60 clock with a divider from 2 to 6, excepted for a frequency <= 66

Remark :
(!b)
This possibility is disabled on the CTCM module because the CTRL1 pin is 
at 1 (connected to the +5V).

The TOS check if the module exist and can change the clock between 33 and 
66 MHz or 66 and 110 MHz according to the strap on the module (see also the 
part 'Change the CT60 frequency'). 

Look at http://www.czuba-tech.com for more informations about this module.

(!B)
Remark :
(!b)
For the frequency to 100 MHz, you must fix the CT60 clock (look at 
'CT60-100 clock'). 


!node TOS in Flash

!subnode Technical

This is a TOS 4.04 patched by the boot (2.0+), in this order there are :

!begin_itemize
!item The validation of the superscalar dispatcher on the 68060 (PCR).
!item The initialization of the translation registers (on all 68060's 
types), the first zone mapped to 0 at $7FFFFFFF in copyback excepted for 
the zone mapped to 0 … $FFFFFF in writethrough, and the second zone mapped 
to $40000000 at $FFFFFFFF in cache inhibed. 
!item The reading and the display of the SDRAM's type from his EEPROM. 
!item The copy of the TOS in SDRAM after apply the patches.
!item The initialization of the PMMU tree. All the ST-RAM is in 
writethrough and the SDRAM declaration in copyback.
!item The installation of the cookies '_CPU', '_FPU', 'CT60', and also 
'_FRQ' (internal clock) and '_FRE' (external clock) if the videl need to 
use an external 32 MHz clock for RGB monitors. The CT60 cookie can return 
the speed frequency of a fan connected on IO3 MFP.
!item The patchs for cache, PMMU, address in $00FFxxxx, and the 
instructions movep replaced.
!item The bombs inside exceptions displayed with texts in clear of a crash.
!item The emulation of unimplemented instructions (integers and FPU).
!item The XBIOS CT60 function $C60A to $C60D (temperature, parameters in 
Flash, cache...), and the DSP (functions with handshake). 
!item The needful patchs for the blitter, the system fonts and the Atari 
logo copied at the top of the ST-RAM (needed if the TOS in ROM is a 4.02).
!item The replacement of the XBIOS Bconout routine (display texts).
!item The picture in 65K colors displayed during 2 seconds.
!item Check and fix the modecode get from NVM.
!item Check and set the serial programmable clock (I2C port).
!item Start the PCI BIOS and the drivers (if drivers.hex is loaded).
!item The display of the 68060's type (revision, mask and frequency).
!item The modification of PCR for the bugged types revision 1.
!item The declaration of the SDRAM to the TOS.
!item The initialization of the SDRAM, and the MB/s during writing 
displayed.
!item The fastram buffer created and his cookie '_FRB'.
!item The extended fastram buffer created and his cookie 'XFRB'.
!item Lot of infos displayed about the SDRAM module.
!item The patch for the boot order of the drives IDE and SCSI (8 choices).
!item Extra boot features :
!begin_itemize
!item Add identify device procedure for SCSI and IDE drives, the boot wait
 if a removable drive is not ready.
!item Add IDE slave support.
!item Add CompactFlash support.
!item Add combined MSDOS/TOS root and partition support, this feature 
 support byte swapping needed by MSDOS format and search a *.SYS for 
 load the disk driver.
!item Add speed test for bootables devices.
!end_itemize
!item The patch for the boot menu.
!item The displays redirection of the AUTO programs to a file boot.log.
!item The patch for the Pexec function for the copyback (cpush after the 
relocation).
!item The blitter patchs of the VDI functions, vro_cpyfm, vr_trnfm, and
vrt_cpyfm for work in SDRAM (an intermediate buffer inside ST-RAM is used).
!item The AES patchs for change the Newdesk buffer of 4 KB to 32 KB.
!item Scan-codes used with the Eiffel card :
!begin_itemize
!item PAGE UP/DOWN.
!item PRINT SCREEN.
!item POWER (set 2 only, Eiffel 1.0.5).
!item VOLUME UP/DOWN (set 2 only, Eiffel 1.0.5).

!subnode Boot menu

The TOS can replace magxboot (MagiC) or ataboot (Linux) in the AUTO 
folder for a fast boot (no programs inside the AUTO folder to start). You  
can enable a boot menu with the configuration CPX. This menu arrives if 
the entry of the favourite OS inside is <> '-'. 

You can select TOS, MagiC or Linux, value is stored inside the NVM.

!begin_itemize
!item With MagiC, the TOS try to found MAGIC.RAM inside the main directory 
of the boot folder. 
!item With Linux, the TOS try to found BOOTARGS inside the main directory 
of the boot folder. Tested with the kernel 2.4.25. 
!end_itemize

Sure you can always use MAGXBOOT.PRG or ATABOOT.PRG inside the AUTO 
folder.

(!U)
ATTENTION !
(!u)

Under the 030 mode, set the default mode to '-'.


!subsubnode Bootargs extension (Linux)

There are a new option for Linux and the bootargs file :

-V <value>: Extended video modecode.

Value is in decimal or hexadecimal C format (0x).

Because the kernel command line has a video=atafb:keep feature, during 
boot it's better to get extended video modes.

This is the detail of this extended (!B) modecode: (!b)

!subnode SDRAM identification

The TOS found the informations inside the EEPROM of the SDRAM for 
configure the SDRAM controler (SDR60). If an error arrive (see the SDRAM 
part for see the types who works) you need to press a key for see this 
'Informations about the SDRAM'.


!subnode SDRAM test

If the reading and the display of the SDRAM's type from his EEPROM is good
but for example if the TOS logo not appears, maybe than the SDRAM is 
defective or not adapted for the CT60.

For test the SDRAM :

!begin_itemize
!item In normal mode and with the configuration CPX for the CT60, set the 
delay at boot to 60 seconds.
!item Switch off the computer.
!item Set the turbo mode.
!item Set the power to on.
!item After the SDRAM initialization (to 0), begin the ST-RAM test and 
after the TT-RAM test (the SDRAM here), if the 'X' characters replaces 
the '-' characters, the SDRAM is defective.

!subnode Help

Select a single test or any combination of tests by typing the 
corresponding letter or letters, then typing the RETURN key. To run 
repeated cycles of the test or (tests), follow the last letter with the 
number of cycles to run. For example, "RSM25", will run RAM, Serial, and 
MIDI tests 25 times. If 0 is entered, testing will be continuous.

Use the ESC key to quit the test cycle. In some cases there will be a 
delay before control returns to the keyboard.

An RS232 terminal may be used for input and display. The Serial RS232 test 
will not pass if a terminal is installed in place of the loopback plug.

Normally a color monitor is used for all tests accept high resolution. If 
an error occurs, an error message will be displayed and the screen will 
turn red. When the test completes, Pass or Fail will be displayed, and the 
screen will turn green or red.

If multiple tests are run and an error occurs on any test, the screen will
remain red, although successive tests pass. Once the test has halted, the
SPACE BAR is used to return to the menu.

The DMA and Printer/joystick/game port tests require that the port test
fixtures be connected.

The O.S. ROM test calculates a checksum/CRC of the ROMs and compares the
resultant CRC with the value found in the ROMs.

If the RAM test fails, the error code, address, data written, data read 
and bad bits (0-15) are displayed.

The short Blitter test does not display any graphics on the screen. The 
long Blitter test, while appearing not to finish the rectangle, is ok.

(!B)
OPERATOR REQUIRED TESTS
(!b)

The Audio, Video, Keyboard, and IDE Hard Disk tests have few error 
messages. The operator must determine if the output results are 
acceptable.

The Gen/lock test is run twice. Toggling the switch on the gen/lock 
fixture should switch between the normal menu and no menu. With no menu a 
"sweeping" cycle should be heard.  Reset the computer with each change of 
the gen/lock switch. 

NOTE - RUN THIS TEST ONLY WITH A COLOR MONITOR.

J2 Joystick time-out. Joystick inputs were simulated by outputting data on 
   the printer port and routing it via the test fixture to the joystick 
   ports. Joysticks inputs are detected by the keyboard and sent to the CPU 
   via the 6850. This error can be caused by printer port failure (code 
   P0), keyboard failure, or keyboard-CPU communication line.

J7 Paddle. The inputs are driven by either 5V/100 ohms or 5V/1M on the 
   test fixture. This current charges the RC network on the FALCON030, 
   varying the output pulse of the LM556.

Since the BOOT v2.0, it's possible to load separate files for the TOS404, the 
BOOT and the PCI drivers for the CTPCI:
!begin_itemize
!item CT60TOS.BIN: contains BOOT + TOS404 + Atari Diagnostics (must disappear).
!item BOOT.HEX: contains the BOOT.
!item DIAG.HEX: contains the Atari Diagnostics.
!item DRIVERS.HEX: contains the PCI drivers (GPL licence, overwrites DIAG.HEX).

The second task is to update the CT60 hardware with two jedec files (.JED) 
for ABE60, SDR60 and CTPCI chips (XILINX XC95144XL / XC95288XL CPLD). 
The update V2.01 allows to program the ETHERNAT (XC9572XL). 

!begin_itemize

!item You need to make the cable for the JTAG CT60 connector linked to // 
port, look at 'JTAG/parallel download cable'.

!item Normally the cable must be attached and powered (by the CT60) for 
proper verification. Only SDR60 can be programmed (or verified) when 
the CT60 is connected to the mother board in normal 030 mode (if you 
use the same machine CT60/F030 ;-) ). If you update the ABE60 chip you 
need to remove the CT60 from the bus excepted if there are a 1Kohms 
resistor between GND (Ground) and the pin #1 of one of the three 74LVC245 
chips. In this case the blitter must not be used (NVDI installed). 

!item If you load the good jedec files, another button appears 'verify'. 
You can use this button for compare the jedec file with the chip. The 
'program' button erase, program, and verify his flash.

!node Configuration

!subnode Introduction

The CT60's configuration is set with a CPX, used normally with XCONTROL, 
ZCONTROL, or COPS. 

This CPX allows to :

!begin_itemize
!item Configure the Non Volatile Memory.
!item Configure the boot in Flash Eprom.
!item Measure MIPS.
!item See the load of the system (MiNT or MagiC only).
!item Measure the temperature of the 68060 (for overclocking) => With the 
driver CT60XBIO.PRG or the TOS in flash. 
!item Switch off the computer.
!item See 'Informations about the SDRAM'.
!end_itemize

!image ..\img\cpx2.img
!begin_verbatim

!end_verbatim

There are five common buttons on this CPX :

!begin_itemize
!item Save : Button for save adjustments on the disk.
!item Load : Button for load adjustments saved on the disk.
!item OK : Button for validate the values changed into the non volatile 
ram and the flash parameters. 
!item Cancel : Button for not change values to the configuration.
!item i : Button for display informations (authors and SDRAM).
!end_itemize

For check the temperature, use curves, get a CPU average load, stop the 
computer, or blank the screen (Radeon/CTPCI), the CPX :

!begin_itemize
!item Under TOS create a desk-accessory CT60TEMP.ACC and ask to reboot.
!item Under MiNT create the program CT60TEMP.APP and start this program.
!item Under MagiC start a thread.
!end_itemize

Note : On the CT63, the temperature level is to 0 (hardware wired by Rodolphe).


!subnode Average load

!image ..\img\cpx1.img
!begin_verbatim

!end_verbatim

At this page you can see for MiNT and MagiC :

!begin_itemize
!item The current value of CPU average load.
!item The level of CPU average load.
!item The curve of CPU average load during the last hour. Without MiNT 1.11 
or more, this curve is very approximate. 
!end_itemize

!subnode Temperature

At this page you can see :

!begin_itemize
!item The current value of the 68060's temperature.
!item The level of the 68060's temperature, Red = Danger.
!item The curve of 68060's temperature during the last hour. This curve is 
normally in green or yellow and change to red when the 68060's temperature 
is dangerous.
!item On occasion the tower's temperature during the last hour if you have 
an Eiffel card (with the cookie 'Temp'). This curve is normally in blue 
and change to magenta if the fan of the tower works (set to on by the 
Effeil card).
!end_itemize

At this page you can change :

!begin_itemize
!item The trigger level for the temperature alarm.
!item If necessary the offset of the analog converter on the CT60 with a 
double-click on the level (offset TLV).
!end_itemize

Notes :

!begin_itemize
!item On the CT63, the temperature level is always at 0 (modification of 
Rodolphe).
!item The level is saved inside the CPX with the 'Save' button (and not 
in NVRAM or flash parameters). It's CT60TEMP.ACC/APP feature.
!item The offset is writed inside a flash parameter with the 'OK' button.

!end_verbatim


!subsubnode Change the CT60 frequency

With the slider inside the page 'Memory / uP' of the CPX, if necessary it's 
possible to change the CT60 frequency.

For do this task, a programmable clock generator module using a CY27EE16 
or a DS1085Z-50 must be connected on the CT60's I2C port with some wires 
(see also the part 'Programmable clock generator'). 

The adjustment works by step of 125 KHz between 50 and 110 MHz for the 
CY27EE16 (ak-modul-bus module), or by step of 50 KHz between 66 and 110 
MHz for the DALLAS DS1085Z-50 (CTCM module), the value is writed in RAM for 
a test after 'OK'. The TOS during the boot when the Atari logo arrive send 
equally this value to the clock, but in case of a problem it's possible to 
bypass this feature and use the original frequency by press CTRL or ALT.

A user clock is available, this is the CT60 frequency divided from 2 to 6.

(!U)
ATTENTION !
(!u)

So long as you not cut the power on the machine, the clock gererator works 
with the latest frequency writed inside his RAM. During the power on 
sequency, the clock generator copy himself inside his RAM the original 
frequency saved in his EEPROM. Press on CTRL or ALT has no effect if you 
not cut the power before. You can also use CTRL-ALT-UNDO for restore 
NVRAM/Flash parameters or use the 030 mode for select another frequency.

(!U)
Initialisation
(!u)

The original frequency saved in EEPROM is also modifiable after a 
confirmation with a double click on 'Save' but it's very dangerous ! 

Yet, when it's impossible to restart the computer, the last solution is 
to connect the (!B) ak-modul-bus module (!b) on the MODEM 2 port with a 
link HE10 SUBD and reprogram in 030 mode the EEPROM of the module with the 
'Save' button. This operation is essential for load a new module. (!B) The 
module must be powered by the CT60 and the signals SDA and SCL must be 
disconnected because during the 030 mode the CT60 force these signals to 
0 ! (!b)

!image ..\img\subd.img
!begin_verbatim

!end_verbatim

When it's impossible to restart the computer with the (!B) CTCM module 
(!b) you must cut the strap for divide by two the frequency (clock between 
33 and 66 MHz), and after reprogram again the module with the CT60 by 
saving a new value inside the EEPROM. Now, the frequency is multiplyed by 
two when the strap is again in place !

The CT60 not start with the Falcon boost if the strap is removed (F030 
frequency > CT60 frequency so 33 MHz).

Like the (!B) ak-modul-bus module (!b), the last solution is to connect 
the (!B) CTCM module (!b) on the MODEM 2 port with a link HE10 SUBD and 
reprogram in 030 mode the EEPROM of the module with the 'Save' button.

(!B)WARNING! The boot 2.0 not support this jumper because the CTCM clock 
is not stable (no PLL) and it's impossible to read the state of the jumper.(!b)
So the frequency range is 66 to 110 MHz (the DALLAS used on the CTCM isn't 
certified for work below 66 MHz).

!subnode BubbleGEM

 Under a multitasking operating system (for example MagiC, MultiTOS, 
Geneva etc) BubbleGEM can be placed in the auto start folder where it 
will be automatically started as a GEM program on booting the system. 

 Under single TOS BubbleGEM can be run as a desk accessory by renaming
BUBBLE.APP to BUBBLE.ACC and copying it to the root directory of your
boot partition, then rebooting.

 BubbleGEM-aware programs send a message and pass a character string to 
BubbleGEM if the user clicks with the right mouse button on an icon,
button or window area.  BubbleGEM then displays the character string,
formatted in a cute speech bubble which remains displayed until the user
moves the mouse pointer to another window area, or until the user clicks
again to burst the bubble.

 Optionally bubbles can be displayed by clicking and holding down the 
right mouse button; in this case the bubble bursts as soon as the 
button is released again.

 While a bubble is open two keyboard shortcuts are active: 
!begin_verbatim
<CTRL C> : The content of the bubble is copied to the clipboard and 
           the bubble remains open. 
<CTRL X> : The content of the bubble is copied to the clipboard and 
           the bubble is closed.

!node Cache

!subnode The 68060's caches

There are two caches of 8KB inside the 68060, data and instruction.

The ST-RAM is in writethrough, at each time than the 68060 write to the 
RAM, he write in the same time than the data cache. 

The SDRAM is in copyback, the 68060 write always inside his data cache, 
he write in the memory the old data of his cache for found some place for 
the new data.

The 68060 has also an instruction cache, witch the direct link with the 
data cache is only the memory. The result is than it's possible to obtain 
incoherency between the data cache and the instruction cache. The example 
is the excecution of a relocated program, without precaution and without 
system call this is a crash.

The 68060 has the ability to watch or snoop the external bus during 
accesses by other bus masters (like DMA or blitter), maintaining coherency 
between the 68060's caches and external memory.


!subnode GENERAL6.CPX

This CPX is a patched version of the Falcon GENERAL.CPX for the 
68060. The cache on/off selection now uses XBIOS calls, there are no 
problems under TOS because this XBIOS is inside the FLASH but under 
MagiC if you use this CPX you need to install CT60XBIO.PRG inside the 
AUTO folder. This program install the XBIOS for the CT60 if the cookie 
'CT60' isn't found.


!subnode XCONTROL, ZCONTROL, COPS, and SDRAM in copyback

!begin_itemize

!item COPS only flush caches after load the CPX and works fine.

!item ZCONTROL works under MiNT 1.16/Xaaes.

!item XCONTROL crashes.

!item The patched XCONTROL.ACC fix this problem by a new XBIOS call but 
under MagiC if you use this ACC you need to install CT60XBIO.PRG 
inside the AUTO folder. 
                     
!end_itemize 


!subnode PARX.SYS modules and the copyback

If a program who use PARX.SYS crashes at start, you can try to remove the 
caches with GENERAL6.CPX, load the program and set to on the caches 
after. For example PICCOLO works with this method.

A global solution is to remove the caches during 5 seconds when a program 
is started under TOS with the Boot menu inside the configuration CPX, but 
this method penalize all programs.


!subnode TSR programs who crashes in the AUTO folder

Like CPX, the programs who not uses the Pexec function for load 
modules crashes with the SDRAM in copyback, so the best way is to load 
the program in ST-RAM (cache in writethrough). You can use FILEINFO.CPX 
for change the flags.

For example you must remove TT-ram flags of METAXBS.PRG (Metados) 
because when the OVL modules are loaded there are no flush after 
relocation, it's not compatible with the SDRAM and the CPU cache in 
copyback. 

A global solution is to remove the caches during 5 seconds when a program 
is started under TOS with the Boot menu inside the configuration CPX, but 
this method penalize all programs.
                                                                                                     

!subnode Programs packed by Ice

The TOS test the programs packed by Ice, there are a patch for flush 
caches (inside the Pexec function). Without this patch, programs packed by 
Ice crashes with the copyback cache (SDRAM). This problem is not solved 
under MagiC or MiNT.


!node Compatibility

!subnode Crashes

You can try to remove the caches with GENERAL6.CPX, start the program who
causes crashes, load the program and set to on the caches after.

You can use FILEINFO.CPX for change the flags and force the program to 
use ST-RAM.

For more informations, you can read the part 'Cache'.


!subnode DSP

The 68060 is lot of faster than the DSP, so some problems arrives with
the host port. The XBIOS fonctions of the TOS fix this problem by 
test the handshake bit during each word send or received. Under MagiC you 
must install the program DSPXBIOS inside the AUTO folder.

The programs who use direct access to the DSP without use the XBIOS 
functions can create problems. For continue to work with this programs, 
you must set the caches to OFF with the CPX GENERAL6.CPX. 


!subnode Patchs

!subsubnode MagiC

This MAGXBOOT.PRG a rewrited for the normal mode (68030) and the turbo 
mode (68060), and in turbo MAGIC.RAM is patched for not overwrite some 
parts of the TOS like FPU emulation, etc... You must install this 
program in the AUTO folder. Tested under MagiC 6.10.

You must use the Centek MAGIC.RAM patch (with MAGIC_P.PRG) before use
MagiC. 

You need to install CT60XBIO.PRG and DSPXBIOS.PRG inside the AUTO 
folder.

If you have the Radeon/CTPCI and drivers.hex loaded, the VDI and the XBIOS 
of the TOS are used for the display.

!subnode HARDWARE EMULATION

The CT60 allows a (!B) Falcon hardware emulation. (!b)

With this Hardware Emulation Window, it is easy to implement a new chip 
replacing the old one of the Falcon motherboard and this at the same 
address(es) !

(!U)
Examples :
(!u)
!begin_itemize
!item SUPER-VIDEL chip in a FPGA with DDR memory.
!item SDRAM replacement of a part of the ST-RAM at the same addresses.
!item ACIA for new PS/2 ports with a CPLD/FPGA.
!item ACIA MIDI with a CPLD/FPGA.
!item DSP56301 replacing 56001 at same addresses !
!item FPGA emulating serial & parallel port of the Falcon (Zilog 85C30 and Yamaha).
!item New SDMA for Audio.
!end_itemize

There is a time window from the start of the 060 access to the Falcon 
addresses ($00xxxxxx and $FFxxxxxx) up to the start (rising edge) of the 
7th cycle of the CLK (bus and 060 clock).

When the 060 inserts the addresses and TS to validate, a counter into ABE 
start if the address is somewhere in the Falcon address space.
Until the counter reaches the end of the 6th cycle, a card on the 060 
slot bus of the CT60 can answer to terminate the access instead of a chip 
of the Falcon mb (with TA/ or TEA/ or both TA/ & TEA/ for a RETRY).
This termination of the access terminates the counter and invalidates the 
Falcon acccess that was started.

At the begining of the 7th cycle the Falcon READ access continues and 
cannot be stopped. ABE drives data on the CT60 bus.

The time limit for the termination signal sampling is the end of the 6th 
cycle.

(!U)
If you want to use SDRAM on a daughter card :
(!u)

For 66 MHz SDRAM BURST READ you need 5-1-1-1 cycles.
The TA arrives the 5th cycle (first data) up to 8th (fourth data). This 
TA arrives before the end of the 6th cycle and the F030 access start is 
cancelled.

For 66 MHz SDRM BURST WRITE you need 3-1-1-1 cyles.
The TA arrives the 3rd cycle (first data) up to 6th (fourth data). This 
TA arrives before the end of the 6th cycle and the F030 access start is 
cancelled.

(!U)
For registers accesses on a daughter card, you need 2 or 3 cycles.
(!u)

If you want to write both to F030 mb AND your daughter card (an address 
that is present on the two boards), don't send TA from the daughter card 
and the TA from mb will terminate the write access for you.

(!U) By example, (!u) this technic allows to write all VIDEL and SUPER VIDEL 
registers in the same time. The emulation is total! The only thing is to do 
is to implement a bit in the daughter board to (!B) switch ON/OFF the 
emulation. (!b)

(!B)
If the switch is ON :
(!b)
!begin_itemize
!item the daugther card address registers are at the same addresses than the 
F030 mb and :
!item the TA must not be sent when writting these registers that are common to 
F030 and the daughter card.
!item the TA must be sent before the 7th cycle when reading from register that 
is a common to F030 & daughter card.
!end_itemize

(!B)
If the switch is OFF :
(!b)
!begin_itemize
!item the daughter card address registers must be present at some specific 
addresses (not the same than the F030) and the TA is sent as usual by the 
daughter card for all read & write accesses.
!end_itemize

(!U)
Example with $FFFF820E :
(!u)

Switch is ON -> Write at $FFFF820E write to daughter card and F030 mb and 
this access is terminated by the TA from Falcon mb (ABE). The card don't 
send TA.

Switch is OFF -> Write at $FFFF820E write only to Falcon mb. You need to 
write to a 'new' address on the card to access the same register.


!subnode THERMAL SENSOR

The 68060 contains a Die Temperature Sensor with two external pins THERM0 
& THERM1. The sensor is done with a temperature sensitive resistor which 
has a 780 ohms value at 25øC and increases/decreases by steps of 2.8 ohms 
per øC unit. By example, a 060 core at 80øC gives a resistance of 934 ohms 
between the two THERMx pins.

(!B)
Equations :  R60 = 780 + 2.8 x (TEMP  25) or TEMP = (R60 - 710) / 2.8
(!b)

The CT60 uses a small slow Analog/Digital converter (TI TLV0831) to obtain 
a 8-Bit value of the voltage between the THERMs pins.  

(!B) The equation is : U60 = (3.34 x R60) / (1000 + R60) (!b) where R60 is 
the value of the core sensor resistor; 3.34 is the power supply and 1000 
is the value of the resistor connected between the 3.34V and the positive 
THERM0/IN+ line.

(!U)
TOLERANCES :
(!u)

!begin_itemize
!item Power supply : 3.3V +/- 4% : From 3.168V to 3.432V. Curently, it is 
3.30 to 3.34. 
!item Resistor : 1K +/-1% : From 990 to 1010 Ohms. Curently, it is from 
995 to 1005 ohms.
!end_itemize

The AD converter uses a REF voltage of 1.800 V. With 0 to 0.007 V between 
the two pins of the AD converter, the digital result is 0. With 1.794 to 
1.800 V, the result is 255. The value increases/decreases by steps of 
0.007 V.

(!B)
The equation is :  Data = INT [U60/0.007]. 
(!b)

!begin_verbatim
At   0øC : Vin+ = 1.387 V  Data = 197  R60=710 
At  25øC : Vin+ = 1.464 V  Data = 208  R60=780 
At  50øC : Vin+ = 1.535 V  Data = 218  R60=850 
At 100øC : Vin+ = 1.662 V  Data = 236  R60=990 
!end_verbatim

(!U)
ATTENTION : The varation of the data is not linear !!
(!u)

The CPU must access the TLV831 by a basic bit-by-bit protocol. It is the 
software responsibility to respect the protocol &  timings of the 
following chronogram, and assemble the bits.

!subsubnode I2C 2-wire PROTOCOL

The EEPROM device conforms to the I2C 2-wire protocol. CT60 only uses the 
random read operations with the EEPROM. 

During data input, the EEPROM samples the SDA signal on the rising edge of 
the clock (SCL). For correct device operation, the SDA signal must be 
stable during the clock low to high transition and data must change only 
when the clock (SCL) line is low. 

!image ..\img\i2c1.img


!subsubnode RANDOM READ PROTOCOL & SOFTWARE

!image ..\img\i2c2.img
 
The slave address is 1010000. The eight bit is the R/W bit.

Random read operations allow the master to access any memory location in a 
random manner. Before issuing the slave address with the R/W bit set to 
one (Read), the master must first perform a dummy write operation. The 
master issues the start condition, slave address and then the word address 
it is to read. After the word address ACK, the master immediately 
re-issues the start condition and the slave address with the R/W bit set 
to one. This will be followed by an ACK from the slave and then by the 
eight bit word. The master will not ACK the transfer but will issue a stop 
and the slave stops transmission and goes into standby.

The device that controls the transfer is referred to as the master (SDR60 
chip) and the device that receives the data (EEPROM) is referred to as the 
slave device. The master will always start a data transfer (SDA line) and 
will provide the serial clock (SCL line) for synchronization.

The 060 CPU must drive the SCL and SDA lines. These lines are connected to 
2 pins of the logic chip. 

The address $F00xxxxx is used for SCL and $F08xxxxx is used for SDA signal.

PERFORMANCES : 
(!b)

The better system performances is obtained with 16 KB page length DIMMs.


!subnode 060 BURST with SDRAM

The CT60 bus clock = the 060 clock (060 in 'Full Bus mode').

The 060 uses (!B) LINE BURST (!b) to & from the system memory. SDRAM is 
well adapted for a such processor !

A BURST LINE is a length of (!B) 4 LONG-WORDs (16 Bytes) (!b) that are 
transferred with only : 

(!B) PAGE HIT (!b) (access to a logical SDRAM page already open) :

!begin_itemize
!item 3,1,1,1 = 6 cycles for Burst Writes. Rate is 16 Bytes / 6 cycles = 
178 MBytes/s (Each access in the same page). 
!item 5,1,1,1 = 8 cycles for Burst Reads. Rate is 16 Bytes / 8 cycles  = 
132 MBytes/s (Each access in the same page).
!end_itemize

(!B) PAGE MISS (!b) (access to a new logical SDRAM page (must be 
precharged and open) : 

!begin_itemize
!item 7,1,1,1 = 10 cycles for Burst Writes. Rate is 16 Bytes / 10 cycles = 
107 MBytes/s (Each access in a new page).
!item 9,1,1,1 = 12 cycles for Burst Reads. Rate is 16 Bytes / 12 cycles  = 
89 MBytes/s (Each access in a new page).
!end_itemize

The CT60 uses the 060 at the top of the possible performances with the 
mighty (!B) COPYBACK (!b) mode ! Instead of the WRITETROUGH mode like 
other TOS machines !

(!B)
Copyback mode is active for all SDRAM memory area.
(!b)

Copyback mode allows the 060 to write into the cache without writting into 
the SDRAM, what is so more performant ! The cache lines are pushed into 
SDRAM only when needed (060 needs place by example). With (!B) two 8Kbytes 
caches, (!b) it gives to coders the possibility to do some incredibly speed 
routs residing at 100% into the caches !

The 060 uses BURST transfers with SDRAM in 99% of the cases. Here are the 
cases when the 060 don't burst, this means, transfers Bytes, Words & 
Long-Words :

For those of you who are a bit familiar with 64-bit processors like PPC, 
don't forget that the syntax for data size is not the same :

!subnode INTERRUPTS

CT60 adds some new interrupts for the 060 Bus Slot, re-routing of the 
Falcon INT Set to the second CPU (CPU#2 on the Bus Slot). 

(!B)
The /I6 , and /INT were added on CT60.
(!b)

/I6 is the interrupt from the 060 BUS SLOT and is merged with the others 
from the Falcon. See table below for the priority position.  

/INT is sent by SDR-60 to the CPU#2 to interrupt it. INT is synthetized 
from the /IPL2, /IPL1 & /IPL0 signals and the I6. It is necessary when the 
CPU#2 has to respond the interrupts instead of the primary 060...

INT6 is also named MFPINT on atari documents because it is daisy chained 
with the MFP. 

To allow the PPC to read the level of the falcon re-routed interrupts, the 
CT60 furnishes a register called (B!) IVR (Interrupt Vector Register). (!b)
The IVR column gives you the binary values encoded by the SDR60 chip...

Note that the INT6, MFPINT and DSPREQ Interrupts are chained on the level 
6 line... (its a stock Falcon feature !). 

It is planned that the PPC board will contain a mechanism register to 
generate a '68K like' INT ACK cycle and receive the software Vector from 
the Falcon data bus. On CT60, the IVR contains only the level of the 
pending INT...
