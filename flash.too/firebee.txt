AHCC currently cant compile correctly:
	dc.l 0x00C222CB, mx_29lv640-devices
	                 ==================

	and similar statements in flash.s.

	This needs a second pass in AHCC assembler, which is not something
	one must do in a hurry.

	Because the assembly will not make any difference in the binary, I
	propose to use the following procedure.

	AHCC 4.3 is needed (updated include directory).

	Very lottle changes in the source were needed:
	Replaced signal by Psignal. I concluded that Mintlib signal
	is only a errno wrapper around Psignal.

Compiling FLASH for the Firebee:

Project file:
	flash_cf.prj

Include folder:
	include (in the folder where AHCCCF resides).
	Make sure the -Iinclude line in the KIT is checked.

First:
	Copy PC.PRG to the AHCC folder.
	Load flash_cf.prj in this Pure C.
	Make sure include is filled out in Compiler options.
	Do a make all.
	This will not produce a binary, but it will compile the
	assembly files correctly.

Then:
	Load flash_cf in AHCCCF.PRG, activate option in the KIT:
	Extra wildcard for make. Wildcard: *.C

	Make All. (Alt + X)
	Only the .C files will be compiled.

Produced binary:
	flash_cf.prg
